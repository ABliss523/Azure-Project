Linux Systems Administration
Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files
Permissions on /etc/shadow should allow only root read and write access.
* Command to inspect permissions: “ls - l shadow”
* Command to set permissions (if needed): “sudo c[a]hmod shadow:root /etc” changes the group so only the root has read and write access.

Permissions on /etc/gshadow should allow only root read and write access.
* Command to inspect permissions: “ls -l gshadow”
* Command to set permissions (if needed): “sudo chown root:root gshadow” changes the group so only the root has read and write access.

Permissions on /etc/group should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.
Command to inspect permissions: “ls -l group”
Command to set permissions (if needed): Not needed.

Permissions on /etc/passwd should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.
Command to inspect permissions: “ls -l passwd”
Command to set permissions (if needed): Not needed.

Step 2: Create User Accounts
Add user accounts for sam, joe, amy, sara, and admin.
* Command to add each user account (include all five users): “sudo adduser (user)” for each user.

Ensure that only the admin has general sudo access.
*Command to add admin to the sudo group: “sudo usermod -aG sudo admin”

Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder
Add an engineers group to the system.
*Command to add group: “sudo addgroup engineers”

Add users sam, joe, amy, and sara to the managed group.
* Command to add users to engineers group (include all four users): “sudo usermod -aG engineers sam amy joe sara”

Create a shared folder for this group at /home/engineers.
* Command to create the shared folder: “mkdir engineers” while in the home directory.

Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the engineers group.
* Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: “sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers”

Step 4: Lynis Auditing
*Command to install Lynis: “wget or curl” and the url for Lynis (https://cisofy.com/files/lynis-<version>.tar.gz) couldn’t find url within VM but through their site.
*Command to see documentation and instructions: “cat default.prf” which is a file within the lynis directory. A link is provided within this for the documentation “https://cisofy.com/documentation/lynis/” and “sudo show lynis commands” to show commands
*Command to run an audit: “sudo lynis audit system” 

Bonus
*Command to install chkrootkit: “sudo apt install chkrootkit -y”
*Command to see documentation and instructions: “man chkrootkit” shows the different options to run chkrootkit under or “sudo chkrootkit -h” 
*Command to run expert mode: “sudo chkrootkit -x”
