Terminal and Bash

Step 1: Investigation Preparation
Made the directories:


mkdir Lucky_Duck_Investigations


cd Lucky_Duck_Investigations


mkdir Roulette_loss_Investigation


cd Roulette_loss_Investigation


mkdir Player_Analysis Dealer_Analysis Player_Dealer_Correlation


touch Player_Analysis/Notes_Player_Analysis Dealer_Analysis/Notes_Dealer_Analysis Player_Dealer_Correlation/Notes_Player_Dealer_Correlation


The final directory, with the analysis and correlation files, should have the following structure:
Lucky_Duck_Investigations/
└── Roulette_loss_Investigation
    ├── Dealer_Analysis
    │   └── Notes_Dealer_Analysis
    ├── Player_Analysis
    │   └── Notes_Player_Analysis
    └── Player_Dealer_Correlation
        └── Notes_Player_Dealer_Correlation

Step 2: Gathering Evidence
Set up the evidence files:

wget "https://tinyurl.com/3-HW-setup-evidence" && chmod +x ./3-HW-setup-evidence && ./3-HW-setup-evidence

Moved over the win/loss files:


mv Roulette_Player_WinLoss_0310/0310* Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Roulette_loss_Investigation/Player_Analysis/


mv Roulette_Player_WinLoss_0310/0312* Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Roulette_loss_Investigation/Player_Analysis/


mv Roulette_Player_WinLoss_0310/0315* Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Roulette_loss_Investigation/Player_Analysis/


Moved over the dealer schedule files:

mv Dealer_Schedules_0310/0310* Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Roulette_loss_Investigation/Dealer_Analysis/
mv Dealer_Schedules_0310/0312* Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Roulette_loss_Investigation/Dealer_Analysis/
mv Dealer_Schedules_0310/0315* Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Roulette_loss_Investigation/Dealer_Analysis/


Step 3: Correlating the Evidence

Player Analysis

Previewed file within Player_Analysis directory:

head 0310_win_loss_player_data


Investigated the losses based on that value and placed into a file called Roulette_Losses:

head 0310_win_loss_player_data | grep - * > Roulette_Losses

Used nano Notes_Player_Analysis to add the data below to the notes files:

Times of losses:
0310_:05:00:00	AM
0310_:08:00:00	AM
0310_:02:00:00	PM
0310_:08:00:00	PM
0310_:11:00:00	PM
0312_:05:00:00	AM
0312_:08:00:00	AM
0312_:02:00:00	PM
0312_:08:00:00	PM
0312_:11:00:00	PM
0315_:05:00:00	AM
0315_:08:00:00	AM
0315_:02:00:00	PM


Discovered the same person appear at every time of loss: Mylie Schmidt.


Figured out the number of times the player played:


grep 'Mylie Schmidt' Roulette_Losses| wc -l


The answer is 13.


Dealer Analysis


Previewed file within Dealer_Analysis directory:

head 0310_Dealer_schedule



Noticed that the columns are separated by four fields ($1, $2, $5, and $6):


The scripts for each time the losses occurred are:
 Dealers_working_during_losses">cat 0310_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '08:00:00 AM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0310_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '02:00:00 PM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0310_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '08:00:00 PM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0310_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '11:00:00 PM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0312_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '05:00:00 AM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0312_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '08:00:00 AM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0312_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '02:00:00 PM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0312_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '08:00:00 PM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0312_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '11:00:00 PM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0315_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '05:00:00 AM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0315_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '08:00:00 AM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses
cat 0315_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep '02:00:00 PM' >> Dealers_working_during_losses



Used nano into Dealers_working_during_losses to add the following notes:


The dealer working during the time of the losses is always Billy Jones.


Figured out the number of times the player played:

grep "Billy Jones" Dealers_working_during_losses | wc -l


The answer is 13.


Player/Employee Correlation


Added to notes file:


There is always one dealer and one player active during the time of the losses: Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt.


They were also both playing and working at the same time on 13 occasions, which is highly suspicious.


Step 4: Scripting Your Tasks


Created shell script that analyzed future employee schedules:

nano roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh


Shell Script:

cat $1_Dealer_schedule | awk -F" " '{print $1, $2, $5,$6}'| grep "$2"


Tested the script:

sh roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh 0310 '02:00:00 PM'

The arguments:

$1 = 0310
$2 = '02:00:00 PM'



After running the script:

02:00:00 PM Billy Jones
