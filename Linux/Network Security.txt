Network Security
The concept of defense in depth can be broken down into three different security control types. Identify the security control type of each set of defense tactics.
1. Walls, bollards, fences, guard dogs, cameras, and lighting are what type of security control?
Physical Control Type
2. Security awareness programs, BYOD policies, and ethical hiring practices are what type of security control?
Administrative Control Type
3. Encryption, biometric fingerprint readers, firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems are what type of security control?
Technical Control Type
Intrusion Detection and Attack indicators
1. What's the difference between an IDS and an IPS?
IDS is intrusion detection and IPS is intrusion prevention
2. What's the difference between an Indicator of Attack and an Indicator of Compromise?
IoA would detect what the attacker is trying to do but IoC describes how the attacker did what they did.
The Cyber Kill Chain
Name each of the seven stages for the Cyber Kill chain and provide a brief example of each.
1. Recon: Gathers information on potential attacker
2. Weaponization: Inputting malicious software onto a target’s device that allows an entrance for the attacker
3. Delivery: When an attacker sends malicious code through email or messaging
4. Exploitation: The compromise of information on a targets machine
5. Installation: Installing malicious code onto a target’s device
6. C2: Used to control another device
7. Exfiltration: Gaining access to the user’s machine
Snort Rule Analysis
Snort Rule #1
1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.
It is alerting the user of inbound TCP traffic from the ports 5800 and 5820.
2. What stage of the Cyber Kill Chain does this alert violate?
The Recon stage.
3. What kind of attack is indicated?
A VNC Scan.
Snort Rule #2
1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.
It is alerting the user of inbound TCP traffic on port 80
2. What layer of the Defense in Depth model does this alert violate?
The policies, awareness, and procedures layer.
3. What kind of attack is indicated?
A “ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP”
Snort Rule #3
* Your turn! Write a Snort rule that alerts when traffic is detected inbound on port 4444 to the local network on any port. Be sure to include the msg in the Rule Option.
Alert tcp Ext_net 444 -> Home_Net any (msg: Possible Trojan or CrackDown)
Part 2: "Drop Zone" Lab
Uninstall ufw 
* Run the command that removes any running instance of ufw.
Command: sudo apt remove ufw
Enable and start firewalld 
By default, these service should be running. If not, then run the following commands:
* Run the commands that enable and start firewalld upon boots and reboots.
* Command: sudo systemctl enable firewalld and sudo systemctl start firewalld
Note: This will ensure that firewalld remains active after each reboot.
Confirm that the service is running.
* Run the command that checks whether or not the firewalld service is up and running.
Command: sudo firewalld-cmd --state
List all firewall rules currently configured.
Next, lists all currently configured firewall rules. This will give you a good idea of what's currently configured and save you time in the long run by not doing double work.
* Run the command that lists all currently configured firewall rules: 
Command: sudo firewall-cmd –list-all
* Take note of what Zones and settings are configured. You many need to remove unneeded services and settings.
List all supported service types that can be enabled.
* Run the command that lists all currently supported services to see if the service you need is available
Command: sudo firewalld-cmd – get-services
* We can see that the Home and Drop Zones are created by default.
Zone Views
* Run the command that lists all currently configured zones.
Command: sudo firewall-cmd –list-all-zones
Create Zones for Web, Sales and Mail.
* Run the commands that creates Web, Sales and Mail zones.
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –new-zone=web
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –new-zone=sales
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –new-zone=mail
Set the zones to their designated interfaces:
* Run the commands that sets your eth interfaces to your zones.
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=public –change-interface=eth0
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=web –change-interface=eth1
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=sales –change-interface=eth2
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=mail –change-interface=eth3
Add services to the active zones:
* Run the commands that add services to the public zone, the web zone, the sales zone, and the mail zone.
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-service=http
   * –add-service-https
   * –add-service=pop3
   * –add-service-smtp
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=web –add-service=http
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=sales –add-service=https
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=mail –add-service=smtp
   * –add-service=pop3
Add your adversaries to the Drop Zone.
* Run the command that will add all current and any future blacklisted IPs to the Drop Zone.
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=drop –add-source=10.208.56.23
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=drop –add-source=135.95.103.76
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=drop –add-source=76.34.169.118
Make rules permanent then reload them:
* Run the command that reloads the firewalld configurations and writes it to memory
Command: sudo firewall-cmd--reload
View active Zones
Now, we'll want to provide truncated listings of all currently active zones. This a good time to verify your zone settings.
* Run the command that displays all zone services.
Command: sudo firewall-cmd –get-active-zones
Block an IP address
* Use a rich-rule that blocks the IP address 138.138.0.3.
Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-rich-rule=’rule=”IPv4” source=138.138.0.3” reject’
Block Ping/ICMP Requests
Harden your network against ping scans by blocking icmp ehco replies.
* Run the command that blocks pings and icmp requests in your public zone.
Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-icmp-block=echo-reply –add-icmp-block=echo-request
Rule Check
Now that you've set up your brand new firewalld installation, it's time to verify that all of the settings have taken effect.
* Run the command that lists all of the rule settings. Do one command at a time for each zone.
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=public –list-all
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=web –list-all
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=sales –list-all
* Command: sudo firewall-cmd –zone=mail –list-all
* Are all of our rules in place? If not, then go back and make the necessary modifications before checking again.
   * Command: sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=drop –list-all
Congratulations! You have successfully configured and deployed a fully comprehensive firewalld installation.

Part 3: IDS, IPS, DiD and Firewalls
Now, we will work on another lab. Before you start, complete the following review questions.
IDS vs. IPS Systems
1. Name and define two ways an IDS connects to a network.
Through the perimeter of the network
Through the host machine of the network
2. Describe how an IPS connects to a network.
